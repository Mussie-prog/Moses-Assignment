            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>
                <h2>Tools for Computer Science</h2>
                    The applications for man-made reasoning are interminable. The innovation can be applied to various areas and ventures. Artificial intelligence is being tried and utilized in the medical services industry for dosing drugs and diverse therapy in patients, and for surgeries in the working room.
                    Different instances of machines with man-made brainpower incorporate PCs that play chess and self-driving vehicles. Every one of these machines should gauge the outcomes of any move they make, as each activity will affect the final product. In chess, the outcome is dominating the match. For self-driving vehicles, the PC framework should represent all outer information and register it to act in a manner that forestalls a crash.
                    Man-made consciousness additionally has applications in the monetary business, where it is utilized to identify and hail action in banking and money, for example, bizarre check card utilization and enormous record stores—all of which help a bank's misrepresentation division. Applications for AI are likewise being utilized to help smooth out and make exchanging simpler. This is finished by making supply, request, and valuing of
                    protections simpler to appraise.
                
                Tools for computer science
                AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered a part of AI. (See AI effect.) According to Russell & Norvig (2003, p. 15), all of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories: time sharing, interactive interpreters, graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse, 
                Rapid application development environments, the linked list data structure, automatic storage management, symbolic programming, functional programming, dynamic programming and object-oriented programming.
    
                AI can be used to potentially determine the developer of anonymous binaries.[citation needed]
    
                AI can be used to create other AI. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. According to Google, NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published ImageNet performance.
    
                <h2>Agriculture</h2>
                In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and to increase the research and development of growing crops. New artificial intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready for picking thus increasing efficiency of farming. These advances go on including Crop and Soil Monitoring, Agricultural Robots, and Predictive Analytics. Crop and soil monitoring uses new algorithms
                 and data collected on the field to manage and track the health of crops making it easier and more sustainable for the farmers.
    
                More specializations of AI in agriculture is one such as greenhouse automation, simulation, modeling, and optimization techniques.
    
                Due to the increase in population and the growth of demand for food in the future, there will need to be at least a 70% increase in yield from agriculture to sustain this new demand. More and more of the public perceives that the adaption of these new techniques and the use of Artificial intelligence will help reach that goal.

                The cybersecurity arena faces significant challenges in the form of large-scale hacking attacks of different types that harm organizations of all kinds and create billions of dollars in business damage. Artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has begun to be used by security companies - for example, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions. The more advanced of these solutions use AI and NLP to
                 automatically sort the data in networks into high risk and low-risk information. This enables security teams to focus on the attacks that have the potential to do real harm to the organization, and not become victims of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Malware and others.
    
                <h2>Education</h2>
                AI tutors could allow for students to get extra, one-on-one help. They could also reduce anxiety and stress for some students, that may be caused by tutor labs or human tutors. In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences. Study devices could be able to create 
                lessons, problems, and games to tailor to the specific student's needs, and give immediate feedback.
    
                But AI can also create a disadvantageous environment with revenge effects, if technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative, unintended effects on society. An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder students’ ability to focus and stay on task instead of helping them learn and grow. Also, AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity.
    
                <h2>Finance</h2>
                Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in the US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards. Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.
    
                Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place. In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition. AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.
    
                AI is increasingly being used by corporations. Jack Ma has controversially predicted that AI CEO's are 30 years away.
    
                The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories. For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets
                 more efficient while reducing the volume of trades[citation needed]. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient. Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking.[20] In August 2019, the AICPA introduced an AI training course for accounting professionals.
    
        
    
                <h2>Government</h2>
                Main article: Artificial intelligence in government
                Artificial intelligence in government consists of applications and regulation. Artificial intelligence paired with facial recognition systems may be used for mass surveillance. This is already the case in some parts of China. Artificial intelligence has also competed in the Tama City mayoral elections in 2018.
    
                In 2019, the tech city of Bengaluru in India is set to deploy AI managed traffic signal systems across the 387 traffic signals in the city. This system will involve use of cameras to ascertain traffic density and accordingly calculate the time needed to clear the traffic volume which will determine the signal duration for vehicular traffic across streets.
    
                <h3>Military</h3>
                Further information: Artificial intelligence arms race, Lethal autonomous weapon, and Unmanned combat aerial vehicle
                The United States and other nations are developing AI applications for a range of military functions. The main military applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are to enhance C2, Communications, Sensors, Integration and Interoperability. AI research is underway in the fields of intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, command and control, and in a variety of semiautonomous 
                and autonomous vehicles. Artificial Intelligence technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Join Fires between networked combat vehicles and tanks also inside Manned and Unmanned Teams (MUM-T). AI has been incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.
    
                Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion in 2015. Military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful asset. Many artificial intelligence researchers seek to distance themselves from military applications of AI.

                AI in healthcare is often used for classification, whether to automate initial evaluation of a CT scan or EKG or to identify high-risk patients for population health. The breadth of applications is rapidly increasing. As an example, AI is being applied to the high-cost problem of dosage issues—where findings suggested that AI could save $16 billion. In 2016, a groundbreaking study in California found that a mathematical formula developed with the help of 
                AI correctly determined the accurate dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to organ patients.
    
                Artificial intelligence is assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer. There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the
                 patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as
                 trained doctors in identifying skin cancers. Another study is using artificial intelligence to try to monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions. One study was done with transfer learning, the machine performed a diagnosis similarly to a well-trained ophthalmologist, and could generate a decision within 30 seconds on whether or not
                 the patient should be referred for treatment, with more than 95% accuracy.
    
                According to CNN, a recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery, and doing so better than a human surgeon, the team claimed. IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the IBM Watson, which has beaten human intelligenc
                e (at some levels). Watson has struggled to achieve success and adoption in healthcare.
