            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are products of both science and myth. The idea that machines could think and perform tasks just as humans do is thousands of years old. The cognitive truths expressed in AI and Machine Learning systems are not new either.
                It may be better to view these technologies as the implementation of powerful and long-established cognitive principles through engineering. We should accept that there is a tendency to approach all important innovations as a Rorschach test upon which we impose
                anxieties and hopes about what constitutes a good or happy world. But the potential of AI and machine intelligence for good does not lie exclusively, or even primarily, within its technologies. It lies mainly in its users. If we trust (in the main) how our societies
                are currently being run then we have no reason not to trust ourselves to do good with these technologies. And if we can suspend presentism and accept that ancient stories warning us not to play God with powerful technologies are instructive then we will likely free
                ourselves from unnecessary anxiety about their use.
                 <br>AI is at the centre of a new enterprise to build computational models of intelligence. The main assumption is that intelligence (human or otherwise) can be represented in terms of symbol structures and symbolic operations which can be programmed in a digital computer. 
                There is much debate as to whether such an appropriately programmed computer would be a mind, or would merely simulate one, but AI researchers need not wait for the conclusion to that debate, nor for the hypothetical computer that could model all of human intelligence. 
                Aspects of intelligent behaviour, such as solving problems, making inferences, learning, and understanding language, have already been coded as computer programs, and within very limited domains, such as identifying diseases of soybean plants, AI programs can outperform 
                human experts. Now the great challenge of AI is to find ways of representing the commonsense knowledge and experience that enable people to carry out everyday activities such as holding a wide-ranging conversation, or finding their way along a busy street. Conventional 
                digital computers may be capable of running such programs, or we may need to develop new machines that can support the complexity of human thought.
